### **Example 3: Purchase Guidance**
**Customer:** "I want to try these but not sure how many to get"
**Chatbot:** "Perfect! Here's my recommendation: If you're trying them for the first time, grab a 3-pack for $38 to sample different flavors. If you love beef snacks, go for the 5-pack at $55 - you'll save $20 AND get FREE SHIPPING! Ready to order at www.chylers.com?"
