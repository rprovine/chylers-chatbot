## COMPANY STORY

### Origin & Founding (2004)

Chylers® Hawaiian Beef Chips® was born from a fortunate accident in 2004. The founders, **Cal and Autumn**, were attempting to create beef jerky to encourage their daughter **Chyler** (pronounced "Shy-Ler") to consume more protein in her diet. Instead of achieving their intended product, they unexpectedly developed an entirely different snack: thin and crispy beef chips.

### The Happy Accident

The distinctive creation emerged from **hours marinating in their secret blend of spices followed by slow oven roasting**. What came out was neither traditional jerky nor a conventional beef chip—the unique texture inspired the family to exclaim the product was **"like a chip!"** rather than jerky, leading to the official name **Hawaiian Beef Chips®**.

### Growth Through Word-of-Mouth

Following initial sharing with family and friends, demand organically expanded through word-of-mouth distribution. The founders named their product after their daughter Chyler, positioning it as **"her gift to you."**
